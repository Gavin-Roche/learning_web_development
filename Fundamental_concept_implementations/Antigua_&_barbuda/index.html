                    <h2>History of Antigua and Barbuda</h2>

                        <p>Antigua was visited in 1493 by Christopher Columbus, who named it for the Church of Santa Maria de la Antigua in Sevilla, Spain. It was colonized by English settlers in 1632 and remained a British possession although it was raided by the French in 1666. The early colonizers were also attacked by Caribs, who were once one of the dominant peoples of the West Indies. At first tobacco was grown, but in the later 17th century sugar was found to be more profitable. The nearby island of Barbuda was colonized in 1678. The crown granted the island to the Codrington family in 1685. It was planned as a slave-breeding colony but never became one; the slaves who were imported came to live self-reliantly in their own community.</p>

                        <p>In the 1970s Antigua had developed an independence movement, particularly under its prime minister George Walter, who wanted complete independence for the islands and opposed the British plan of independence within a federation of islands. Walter lost the 1976 legislative elections to

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vere_Bird">Vere Bird</a>, who favoured regional integration. In 1978 Antigua reversed its position and announced it wanted independence. The autonomy talks were complicated by the fact that Barbuda, long a dependency of Antigua, felt that it had been economically stifled by the larger island and wanted to secede. Finally, on November 1, 1981, Antigua and Barbuda achieved independence, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vere_Bird">Vere Bird</a> as the first prime minister. The state obtained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> and Commonwealth membership and joined the Organization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Eastern_Caribbean_States">Eastern Caribbean States</a>. Bird’s Antigua Labour Party (ALP) won again in 1984 and 1989 by overwhelming margins, giving the prime minister firm control of the islands’ government.</p>
